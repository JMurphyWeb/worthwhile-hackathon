# OxFizz

### What
 A database of volunteers that can be sorted and filtered to produce most relevant people by various criteria such as: location, degree subject, further study, subject area, and 'quality' of volunteer

### Why
Current system is unwieldy, depends on personal knowledge, and is not systematic nor easily sustainable/upscalable. An improved version would save time and make it easier for anyone without knowledge of the volunteers to find the best volunteers for a given job.

### How
 key features: filters, searchable, easily updateable database with new volunteers,  and to produce an easily copy/pasteable list of email addresses for volunteers

### Who for
 the OxFizz team (particularly Recruitment and Training Coordinator)
